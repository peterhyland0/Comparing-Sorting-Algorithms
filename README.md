# Comparing-Sorting-Algorithms
In this project I coded 4 different sorting algorithms: heap sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and quicksort. These sorting algorithms were tested using various length and randomizations of list to see which performed the best. I then tested chatGPT's versions of these algorithms against the initial versions to see which performed more efficently.
